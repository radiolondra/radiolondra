âš¡ Â Â **Roberto** (*radiolondra*) is a first-class C/C++ (and other 18 programming languages) guy.

âš¡Â Â Â Ther's something magic in his code as he's able to change impossible things in something easy to do.

âš¡Â Â Â He started creating magic more than 40 years ago with his new multitasking operating system (MT-DOS, Spectrum Spa, Military Defense Systems Departement), while MS-DOS was able to run just one task at a time with difficulty. 

âš¡Â Â Â He finds his flair (for the job and the life) pumping up Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Genesis and Dire Straits long play records with his old McIntosh hi-fi amplifier, and catches (nobody knows how) *ethereal creative solutions* from music. 

âš¡Â Â Â The magic continues in his kitchen, where he's able to prepare the best '*Scarpariello Pasta*' you never tasted before, and in his family too, where he is named '*the lighthouse*'.

âš¡Â Â Â He is always looking for new job opportunities to fully unleash his creativity.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on **TinyML** projects using [Neuton](https://neuton.ai/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
